# Personal Projects

I have no idea how I can use freshly acquired words in my writing. However, I have an idea of how to improve the quality of my writing in general. In order to do that I have to slow down and consider my words. Even better, before writing thoughts down, put some thoughts on them and consider using expressions and idioms I didn't use before.

I should approach my personal projects more meticulously and do my best to make my work better with each attempt. Also, I should not give up on projects too early. Every time I give on a project prematurely I lose the opportunity to learn useful skills and enjoy finishing a project.

It's difficult to write in English but it's totally worth it. I often dream about being a successful author because an ability to write clearly all the time attracts me. That's the sole reason I want to be an author and write regularly.
