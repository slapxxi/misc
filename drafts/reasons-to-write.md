# Reasons to Write

I want to be a writer. One who writes every day or at least tries to write every day. I don't want to be a writer because I want to become famous or rich. I just want to get better at articulating my thoughts and want to think clearly.

I write to understand better. In order to better understand some topic I write about it utilizing the words I use to think about the topic. That gives me an ability to see clearly what I don't understand and what I do understand, thus allowing me to improve my knowledge.

I write to generate new ideas on a given topic. Given some prior knowledge and ideas on some topics I write further in order to gain more insights and generate more new ideas.

I write to share my thoughts with others. Being able to share you thinking with others is a great way to improve and exchange ideas. Together with other people, it's possible to achieve a better quality of ideas and reasoning in general.

Writing is really difficult for me for numerous reasons I can't describe here. I think writing should be difficult since thinking is difficult and writing is just a form of thinking. However, there are some tricks to make it easier.

## Reasons My Writing is not Good Enough

I suppose that my writing is always not good enough, so I always try to make it better.

My writing sucks because my thinking is vague. When my thinking is clear, my writing is also clear and there's no a single problem to write about what I think.

The problem is that I can't think in English right now and thus cannot write clearly for a long time. In order to write clearly I need to think clearly. Otherwise, I won't be ablt to produce clear writing.
