## The Tell-Tale Brain

This question of our special status, which will reappear many times in this book, has a long and *contentious* history. It was a major *preoccupation* of *intellectuals* in Victorian times. The *protagonists* were some of the giants of nineteenth-century science, including Thomas Huxley, Richard Owen, and Alfred Russl Wallace. Even though Darwin started it all, he himself *shunned* controversy. But Huxley, a large man wich *piercing* dark eyes and *bushy* eyebrows, was *renowned* for his *pugnacity* and wit and had no such *compunctions*. Unlike Darwin, he was *outspoken* about the *implications* of evolutionary theory for humans, earning him the epithet "Darwin's bulldog."

Joining the *fray* was Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, a *staunch* creationist who often relied on Owen's anatomical observations to challenge Darwin's theory. He *wryly* *quipped* to the reporter, "At long last the Bishop's brain has come into contact with hard reality, and the result has been fatal."

Modern biology has *amply* demonstrated that Owen was wrong: There is no hippocampus minor, no sudden *discontinuity* between apes and us. The view that we are special is generally thought to be held only by creationist *zealots* and religious fundamentalists.

It is a common *fallacy* to assume that gradual, small changes can only *engender* gradual, incremental results.

Within the space of perhaps thirty thousand years we began to build our own shelters, *stitch hides* and furs into *garments*, create shell jewelry and rock paintings, and carve flutes out of bones. We were more or less finished with genetic evolution, but had *embarked* on a much faster-paced form of evolution that acted not on genes but on culture.
